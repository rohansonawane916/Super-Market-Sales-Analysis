# Super-Market-Sales-Analysis

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Supermarket Sales Analysis Dashboard! ðŸ“Š

In this project, I analyzed supermarket sales data to uncover key trends in customer behavior, product performance, and payment preferences. Using Power BI, I transformed raw sales data into an interactive dashboard that provides valuable business insights.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
ðŸš€ Comprehensive Sales Insights â€“ Analyzed total gross income of $15,379.37, total invoices, and average unit price.
ðŸš€ Customer Behavior Analysis â€“ Explored gender-wise shopping trends, showing an almost equal split between male (499) and female (501) customers.
ðŸš€ Peak Shopping Hours â€“ Identified average sales quantity trends across different hours of the day.
ðŸš€ Branch & Customer Type Analysis â€“ Segmented customer types (Members vs. Normal) across different branches.
ðŸš€ Payment Preferences â€“ Discovered that Credit Card (35.05%) is the most used payment method, followed by E-wallet (32.75%) and Cash (31.98%).
ðŸš€ Product Performance â€“ Categorized product lines based on sales volume, with Fashion Accessories, Food & Beverages, and Electronics leading the count.

This dashboard empowers businesses with data-driven decision-making, helping them optimize product strategies and enhance customer experiences. Excited to explore more insights and trends! ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
